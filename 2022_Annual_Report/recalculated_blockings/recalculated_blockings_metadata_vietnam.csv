field,field_description
domain,The domain to search measurements for
input,The input (for example a URL or IP address) to search measurements for
measurement_start_time,"The start date of when measurements were run (ex. ""2016-10-20T10:30:00"")"
category,The category code from the citizenlab list
description,Category description
network_name,Name of the network of the probe
probe_asn,"the Autonomous system number of the probe in the format ""ASXXX"""
resolver_asn,"the Autonomous system number of the DNS resolver in the format ""ASXXX"""
network_type,"Type of network used, either WiFi, Mobile, VPN, or Unknown"
origin,"Source of measurements, either ooni-run, auto-run (ie automated testing) or unknown"
platform,Operating system used by the probe
blocking,type of blocking
blocking_recalc,type of blocking reclassifed after running heuristics
suspection,DNS inconsistent or DNS confirmed
dns.bogon,a bogon IP address was returned
dns.confirmed,one of the returned IPs matches an IP known to be used to implement blocking
dns.inconsistent,our DNS consistency heuristics determined the returned IP to be inconsistent
dns.no_ipv4,no IPv4 address was returned
dns.nxdomain,"we got an NXDOMAIN response from the probe, but we got a valid response from the control vantage point"
http.confirmed,the returned page is a known blockpages
http.connection_closed,the connection was closed before all data was transmitted
http.connection_reset,we got a connection reset to a plaintext HTTP request
http.connection_timeout,the connection timed out before we could retrieve all the data
http.generic_failure,this is an generic error from legacy OONI probes
http.http_diff,the page doesn't match based on our page consistency heuristics
invalid,unknown failures
tcp.connection_timeout,the TCP connect test failed with a timeout
tls.connection_closed,the connection was closed after the ClientHello
tls.connection_reset,a reset packet was seen after the client sent the ClientHello packet
tls.connection_timeout,the connection timed out after the ClientHello
tls.generic_failure,generic error from legacy OONI probes
tls.mitm,"The DNS is consistent, but the TLS certificate validation failed. This suggest a TLS man-in-the-middle"
ok,Successful measurements (i.e. NO sign of internet censorship)
block,dns.confirmed
