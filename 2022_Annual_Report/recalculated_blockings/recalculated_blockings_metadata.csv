dns_resolved_ips,IP address of the DNS server of the website
input,The input (for example a URL or IP address) to search measurements for
domain,The domain to search measurements for
measurement_start_time,"The start date of when measurements were run (ex. ""2016-10-20T10:30:00"")"
report_id,"The report_id to search measurements for. On OONI Explorer, one is able to search for measurements in this format: “https://explorer.ooni.org/measurement/<report_id>?input=<input>”"
dns.bogon,a bogon IP address was returned
dns.confirmed,one of the returned IPs matches an IP known to be used to implement blocking
dns.inconsistent,our DNS consistency heuristics determined the returned IP to be inconsistent
dns.no_ipv4,no IPv4 address was returned
dns.nxdomain,"we got an NXDOMAIN response from the probe, but we got a valid response from the control vantage point"
http.confirmed,the returned page is a known blockpages
http.body.confirmed,the http body of returned page is a known blockpages
http.connection_closed,the connection was closed before all data was transmitted
http.connection_reset,we got a connection reset to a plaintext HTTP request
http.connection_timeout,the connection timed out before we could retrieve all the data
http.generic_failure,this is an generic error from legacy OONI probes
http.http_diff,the page doesn't match based on our page consistency heuristics
invalid,unknown failures
ok,Successful measurements (i.e. NO sign of internet censorship)
tcp.connection_reset,the TCP connect test failed due to a reset packet
tcp.connection_timeout,the TCP connect test failed with a timeout
tls.connection_closed,the connection was closed after the ClientHello
tls.connection_reset,a reset packet was seen after the client sent the ClientHello packet
tls.connection_timeout,the connection timed out after the ClientHello
tls.generic_failure,generic error from legacy OONI probes
tls.mitm,"The DNS is consistent, but the TLS certificate validation failed. This suggest a TLS man-in-the-middle"
